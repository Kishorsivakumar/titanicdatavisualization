Introduction
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets for practicing data analysis and machine learning. In this project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors that affected the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic.

The dataset contains information such as age, sex, passenger class, and embarked location. The analysis aims to answer several key questions and provide insights into the data.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger

Pclass: Passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

Name: Name of the passenger

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Fare: Fare paid for the ticket

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

Survived: Survival status (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the analysis

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib: Visualization of data through various plots

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code

Data Analysis & Visualization
In this project, we perform several key analyses:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data cleaning and exploration.

Survival Rate Visualization: Visual representation of survival rates by various factors such as age, gender, and class.

Correlation Analysis: Understanding how different features correlate with survival outcomes.

Feature Distribution: Plots showing the distribution of different features like age, fare, and the number of siblings/spouses aboard.

Key Insights
Through data visualization, the following key insights were identified:

Gender Impact: Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.

Class Impact: Passengers in the 1st class had a significantly higher survival rate than those in 3rd class.

Age Distribution: Younger passengers had higher survival rates compared to older passengers.

These insights provide valuable perspectives for predictive modeling, where these features can help improve the accuracy of survival predictions.
